Good evening,

I would like to use Genymotion with Android Chrome. For some reason,
it doesnt seem to come preinstalled, unlike Android Studio. I was able
to get the Play Store by running Open Gapps, but after I installed
Android Chrome, it just crashes every time I open it. I am running on
Android Oreo.

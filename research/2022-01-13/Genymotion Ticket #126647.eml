Hi,

We don't reproduce on our Windows testing machines (response times are si=
milar to your Android Studio benchmark) and we had no issues with Google =
Chrome either.

The logs suggest that a display error occurred, which seems related to yo=
ur display driver.

Could you make sure that your NVIDIA display drivers are up-to-date (your=
 current drivers date back from 2019-07-23 whereas the latest version has=
 been released on 2021.12.20)?

If this does not help, try to upgrade VirtualBox:

1. Uninstall VirtualBox
1. Download and install VirtualBox 6.1.30 for windows host from https://w=
ww.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
1. Reboot your PC
1. Open Genymotion, delete your device and re-create it

Thank you.
Best regards,
